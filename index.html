            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>I have spent a considerable amount of time learning about how computers work. From an early age, I have been fascinated with how the modern computer is logical magic. After moving through my first programming class is high school, I was intrigued to learn more about exactly how these machines operated.</p>
            <p>I headed to college, where I studied linguistics, or the scientific approach to understanding language. I realized that my passion in programming pointed to a more abstract one, a love of language. I found a great friend there, who became my partner, with whom's company I still am graced. I graduated from the University of Florida in 2017, and have since attended a programming school, Flatiron School, in pursuit of furthering my techincal abilities.</p>
            <p>Upon completion of my program at Flatiron in 2020, I was asked to join the team as an instructor of software engineering. I have been working from home since then, providing instruction and techincal support to over 500 students in my time at the company.</p>
            <p>This is where my story intersects with the present. I will add more biographical information as it occurs. Given the length of the section, it will take something quite important to cause a change in the near future.</p>

            <h3>Work at Flatiron School</h3>
            <p>I have spent about 2 years working for Flatiron School as of today, September 12 2022. I began shortly after finishing the software engineering program in 2020. The curriculum at the time focused on both the theoretical discussion and implementation of a full stack web application. The backend technology, which was tuaght first, used Ruby and Rails with relational databases. The frontend was comprised of templating technology provided by Rails (ERB), and then React with Rails as a web API.</p>
            <p>Since then, the curriculum has shifted to a front end first layout, with vanilla javascript and React taught first, and following up with the backend using Rails. The curriculum is front-end focused, with a concentration on the microservice-based approach the web is taking in today's world. This means a clear distinction between the backend server and the frontend client. This also means that javascript controlls client side routing, rather than the browser making default requests. These applications that allow javascript to control routing are referred to as Single Page Applications (SPA), and are the only way Flatiron School teaches front end implementation.</p>
            <p>I spend about 20 hours a week in a one on one paradigm with student engineers, helping them build and refine their critical thinking process. I assist in every aspect of the curriculum, including work in data structures and algorithms, and system administration. I hold hour-long workshops every day for several cohorts, which cover a range of subtopics of the technologies mentioned just before this, and in the paragraph above.</p>
            <p>I spend much of my day programming, but I have experience leading a team of software coaches, along with administrative duties including holding techincal interviews and onboarding new team members. I have had to assume several roles in my short time here so far, and enjoy the ability to help out where I am needed, while making sure my techincal abilities are put to use.</p>

            <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
            <p>In addition to working at Flatiron, I have built out several of my own personal projects. Each one touches on a different technology stack or programming paradigm. I have written full stack web applicationsand APIs, including other hobby projects such as game engines. I also maintain and develop the web service for Deep Blue Dynamic LLC, my consulting company. I will list several of my projects below, with links to source code. </p>
