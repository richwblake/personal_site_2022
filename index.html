            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>I have spent a considerable amount of time learning about how computers work. From an early age, I have been fascinated with how the modern computer is logical magic. After moving through my first programming class is high school, I was intrigued to learn more about exactly how these machines operated.</p>
            <p>I headed to college, where I studied linguistics, or the scientific approach to understanding language. I realized that my passion in programming pointed to a more abstract one, a love of language. I found a great friend there, who became my partner, with whom's company I still am graced. I graduated from the University of Florida in 2017, and have since attended a programming school, Flatiron School, in pursuit of furthering my techincal abilities.</p>
            <p>Upon completion of my program at Flatiron in 2020, I was asked to join the team as an instructor of software engineering. I have been working from home since then, providing instruction and techincal support to over 500 students in my time at the company.</p>
            <p>This is where my story intersects with the present. I will add more biographical information as it occurs. Given the length of the section, it will take something quite important to cause a change in the near future.</p>
